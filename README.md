# Detection in Crowded Scenes: One Proposal, Multiple Predictions

# Convert HIE20 Data to Crowd Person Format

You can use the script `hie2crowddet.py` to replace the original `hie2mmdet.py`. 

# Previous Readme

This is the pytorch implementation of our paper "[Detection in Crowded Scenes: One Proposal, Multiple Predictions](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Chu_Detection_in_Crowded_Scenes_One_Proposal_Multiple_Predictions_CVPR_2020_paper.html)", https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09163, published in CVPR 2020.

Our method aiming at detecting highly-overlapped instances in crowded scenes. 

The key of our approach is to let each proposal predict a set of instances that might be highly overlapped rather than a single one in previous proposal-based frameworks. With this scheme, the predictions of nearby proposals are expected to infer the **same set** of instances, rather than **distinguishing individuals**, which is much easy to be learned. Equipped with new techniques such as EMD Loss and Set NMS, our detector can effectively handle the difficulty of detecting highly overlapped objects.

# Run
1. Requirements:
    * python 3.6.8, pytorch 1.5.0, torchvision 0.6.0, cuda 10.1

2. CrowdHuman data:
    * CrowdHuman is a benchmark dataset to better evaluate detectors in crowd scenarios. The dataset can be downloaded from http://www.crowdhuman.org/. The path of the dataset is set in `config.py`.

3. Steps to run:
    * Step1:  training. More training and testing settings can be set in `config.py`.
	```
	cd tools
	python3 train.py -md rcnn_fpn_baseline
	```
    
	* Step2:  testing. If you have four GPUs, you can use ` -d 0-3 ` to use all of your GPUs.
			  The result json file will be evaluated automatically.
	```
	cd tools
	python3 test.py -md rcnn_fpn_baseline -r 40
	```
    
	* Step3:  evaluating json, inference one picture and visulization json file.
			  ` -r ` means resume epoch, ` -n ` means number of visulization pictures.
	```
	cd tools
	python3 eval_json.py -f your_json_path.json
	python3 inference.py -md rcnn_fpn_baseline -r 40 -i your_image_path.png 
	python3 visulize_json.py -f your_json_path.json -n 3
	```

# Models

We use MegEngine in the research (https://github.com/megvii-model/CrowdDetection), this proiect is a re-implementation based on Pytorch.
<!-- We use pre-trained model from Detectron2 Model Zoo: https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/ImageNetPretrained/MSRA/R-50.pkl. (or [R-50.pkl](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qWAwY8QOhYRazxRuIhRA55b8YDxdOR8_)) -->
We use pre-trained model from [MegEngine Model Hub](https://megengine.org.cn/model-hub) and convert this model to pytorch. You can get this model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lfYQHC63oM2Dynbfj6uD7XnpDIaA5kNr/view?usp=sharing).
These models can also be downloaded from [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1U3I-qNIrXuYQzUEDDdISTw)(code:yx46).
